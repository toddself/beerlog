  "type": "31. Alternative Fermentables Beer",
  "description": "This category contains specialty beers that have some additional ingredient(grain or sugar) that adds a distinctive character.",
  "subtypes": [{
    "type": "31A. Alternative Grain Beer",
    "Overall Impression": "A base beer enhanced by or featuring the character of additional grain or grains. The specific character depends greatly on the character of the added grains.",
    "Aroma": "Same as base beer style. The added grain will lend a particular character, although with some grains the beer will simply seem a bit more grainy or nutty. The alternative grain should provide the major aroma profile for this beer.",
    "Appearance": "Same as base beer style, although some additional haze may be noticeable.",
    "Flavor": "Same as base beer style. The additional grain should be noticeable in flavor, although it may not be necessarily identifiable. However, the alternative grain should provide the major flavor profile for this beer. Different grains have different characters; the additional grain should enhance the flavor of the base beer. Many will add an additional grainy, bready, or nutty flavor.",
    "Mouthfeel": "Same as the base beer, although many additional grains will tend to increase the body (oats, rye) and increase the viscosity, while some may decrease the body (GF grains) resulting in thinness. ",
    "Comments": "If the alternative grain does not provide a noticeable distinguishable character to the beer, enter it as the base style. This style should not be used for styles where the alternative grain is fundamental to the style definition (e.g., Rye IPA, Oatmeal Stout, Rice- or Corn-based International Lager). Note that sake is not beer, and is not intended for this category.",
    "Entry Instructions": "The entrant must specify a base style, but the declared style does not have to be a Classic Style. The entrant must specify the type of alternative grain used. ",
    "Commercial Examples": "Green's Indian Pale Ale, Lakefront New Grist, New Planet Pale Ale",

  }, {
    "type": "31B. Alternative Sugar Beer",
    "Overall Impression": "A harmonious marriage of sugar and beer, but still recognizable as a beer. The sugar character should both be evident but in balance with the beer, not so forward as to suggest an artificial product.",
    "Aroma": "Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (honey, molasses, etc.) may add an aroma component. Whatever additional aroma component is present should be in balance with the beer components, and be a pleasant combination.",
    "Appearance": "Same as the base beer, although some sugars will bring additional colors.",
    "Flavor": "Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (honey, molasses, etc.) may add a flavor component. Whatever additional flavor component is present should be in balance with the beer components, and be a pleasant combination. Added sugars should not have a raw, unfermented flavor. Some added sugars will have unfermentable elements that may provide a fuller finish; fully fermentable sugars may thin out the finish.",
    "Mouthfeel": "Same as the base beer, although depending on the type of sugar added, could increase or decrease the body.",
    "Comments": "If the additional fermentables do not add a distinguishable character to the beer, enter it in the base style category. A honey-based beer should not have so much honey that it reads more like a mead with beer (i.e., a braggot) than a honey beer. This style should not be used for styles where the alternative sugar is fundamental to the style definition, or where a small amount of neutral-flavored sugar is used simply to increase gravity, increase attenuation, or lighten flavor or body; those beers should be entered as the normal base style.",
    "Entry Instructions": "The entrant must specify a base style, but the declared style does not have to be a Classic Style. The entrant must specify the type of sugar used. ",
    "Commercial Examples": "Bell's Hopslam, Fullers Honey Dew, Lagunitas Brown Shugga'",
